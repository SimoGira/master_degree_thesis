Developing distributed robotics applications on embedded devices, we have to deal with the heterogeneity of both the software applications and the hardware platforms where these applications run.
At the state of the art there are some solutions that help us to develop robotics applications and deploy them on embedded boards. 
The problem is that none of these solutions allows us to be sufficiently accurate to guarantee the functionality by satisfying non-functional constraints (i.e. performance, accuracy, energy efficiency reliability, data privacy and security, etc.) of the entire system, especially if we want to increase its complexity.
To solve this problem, we have to take account of the necessary resources to run the applications and the constraints imposed by the limits of the devices.
