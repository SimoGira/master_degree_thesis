Developing distributed robotics applications on embedded devices, we have to deal with the diversity of the applications and the different platforms where these applications run.
At the state of the art there are some solitutions that allow us to develop robotics applications and deploy them on embedded boards. 
The problem is that none of these solutions allows us to be sufficiently accurate to guarantee the functioning of the entire system, esapecially if we want to increase its complexity.
To solve the problem we must to take account of the necessary reasources to run the applications and the constraints imposed by the limits of the devices.
