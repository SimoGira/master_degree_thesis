In this thesis, we presented a design flow based on Kubernetes platform and ROS for edge computing. We showed that it is possible for KubeEdge to manage remote edge nodes and deploy and manage applications into the edge with the same API.
% We implemented a communication protocol to allow
% seamless bidirectional communication between cloud and
% edge for applications leveraging both edge resources and
% cloud. 
% 
% 
% We extended Kubernetes model from centralized data
% center deployment into the edge with EdgeController and
% EdgeCore components.

This work is a preliminary experience and we intend to optimize and enhance KubeEdge as future work.
 
% One future work we consider is the concept and design
% of edge mesh network. In the current communication model,
% the inter-edge communication is through KubeBus at the
% cloud side. We have seen the scenarios that multiple edge
% nodes need to communicate each other directly without cloud,
% mainly due to local private network policies and data security.
% With the direct connections among edge nodes, KubeEdge
% will form a virtual network mesh among all edge nodes, and
