@misc{ruder2016overview,
	abstract = {Gradient descent optimization algorithms, while increasingly popular, are
	often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their
	strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the
	reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms
	that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look
	at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the
	most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and
	distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing
	gradient descent.},
