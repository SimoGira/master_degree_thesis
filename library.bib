abstract = {Robot-assisted ultrasound-guided breast biopsy combines ultrasound (US) imaging with a robotic system for medical interventions. This study was designed to provide a literature review of a robotic US-guided breast biopsy system to delineate its efficacious impact on current medical practice. In addition, the strengths and limitations of this approach were also addressed. Articles published in the English language between 2000 and 2016 were appraised in this review. A wide range of systems that bind robotics with US imaging and guided breast biopsy were examined in this article. The fundamental safety and real-time imaging capabilities of US, together with the accuracy and maneuverability of robotic devices, is clearly an effective association with unmatched capabilities. Numerous experimental systems have obvious benefits over old-fashioned techniques, and the future of robot-assisted US-guided breast biopsy will be characterized by increasing levels of automation, and they hold tremendous possibility to impact doctor achievement, patient recovery, and clinical management.},

abstract = {Needle insertion in soft tissue has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its application in minimally invasive percutaneous procedures such as biopsies and brachytherapy. This paper presents a survey of the current state of research on needle insertion in soft tissue. It examines the topic from several aspects, e.g. modeling needle insertion forces, modeling tissue deformation and needle deflection during insertion, robot-assisted needle insertion, and the effect of different trajectories on tissue deformation. All studies show that the axial force of a needle during insertion in soft tissue is the summation of different forces distributed along the needle shaft such as stiffness force, frictional force and cutting force. Some studies have modeled these forces. The force data in some procedures is used for identifying tissue layers as the needle is inserted or for path planning. Needle deflection and tissue deformation are major problems for accurate needle insertion and attempts have been made to model them. Using current models several insertion techniques have been developed which are briefly reviewed in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2006 IPEM.},

We present a force model for needle insertion and experimental procedures for acquiring data from ex vivo tissue to populate that model. Data were collected from bovine livers using a one-degree-of-freedom robot equipped with a load cell and needle attachment. computed tomography imaging was used to segment the needle insertion process into phases identifying different relative velocities between the needle and tissue. The data were measured and modeled in three parts: 1) capsule stiffness, a nonlinear spring model; 2) friction, a modified Karnopp model; and 3) cutting, a constant for a given tissue. In addition, we characterized the effects of needle diameter and tip type on insertion force using a silicone rubber phantom. In comparison to triangular and diamond tips, a bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations. Forces for larger diameter needles are higher due to increased cutting and friction forces.},

@article{Hochman2000,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a bidirectional rotation insertion technique on the force necessary to puncture and advance a needle through a tissuelike substance. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Two in vitro penetration test models were constructed using different tissuelike substances of different densities. Each tissuelike substance was tested with 30-gauge, 27-gauge, and 25-gauge needles of two brands commonly used in dentistry. The needles were placed to a standardized depth of 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) at a standardized rate of insertion. A customized dental surveyor allowed controlled forces to be applied. A linear insertion technique and a newly described bidirectional rotation insertion technique were tested. The force of puncture and penetration drag was recorded with an electronic digital scale. A total of 400 needle insertions were performed. RESULTS: A multivariate analysis of technique, material, needle gauge, and needle brand revealed the data to be statistically significant, demonstrating no overlap. The post-hoc analysis of between-subject effects found that the needle insertion technique accounted for the most powerful effect in reducing force penetration. The bidirectional insertion technique had the greatest influence on reducing the force penetration irrespective of material, needle gauge, or needle brand tested in this study. CONCLUSION: The bidirectional rotation insertion technique required two to three times less force than did a standard linear insertion technique. A continuous rotation in a single direction would be expected to produce similar results. Needle gauge and needle design have a smaller effect on reducing force penetration than did the technique used during insertion. The in vitro model used in this study represents a reliable dynamic testing system that can be used for future evaluation of needles.},

@article{Balter2017,
abstract = {Synapses are highly plastic and are modified by changes in patterns of neural activity or sensory experience. Plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses is thought to be important for learning and memory, leading to alterations in sensory representations and cognitive maps. However, these changes must be coordinated across other synapses within local circuits to preserve neural coding schemes and the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, i.e., excitatory-inhibitory balance. Recent studies indicate that inhibitory synapses are also plastic and are controlled directly by a large number of neuromodulators, particularly during episodes of learning. Many modulators transiently alter excitatory-inhibitory balance by decreasing inhibition, and thus disinhibition has emerged as a major mechanism by which neuromodulation might enable long-term synaptic modifications naturally. This review examines the relationships between neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity, focusing on the induction of long-term changes that collectively enhance cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance for improving perception and behavior.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the goals of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is to balance the loads between the compartments of the knee. An instrumented load cell that measures compartment loads in real time is utilized to evaluate conventional, qualitative methods of achieving this balance. METHODS: TKA was performed on 10 cadaveric knees. Prior to and after load balancing, compartment forces were measured at flexion angles of 0-90 degrees. Knees were randomly assigned into one of two groups, based upon whether or not the surgeons could visualize the load cell's output during balancing. RESULTS: Prior to attempting load balance, there were significant differences between the medial and lateral compartment loads for all knees (p {\textless} 0.05). After attempting balance with the aid of the load cell, there was equal load balance at all angles studied. Without the aid of the load cell, balance was not consistently achieved at every angle. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional load balancing techniques in TKA are not perfect.},

abstract = {A variety of medical robots for stereotactic neurosurgery has been developed in re-cent years. Almost of all these robots use computed tomography (CT) to scan the brain of the patient before and during surgery. Currently, we are developing a needle insertion manipulator for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided neurosurgery. MRI techniques, including MRI angiog-raphy and functional MRI, are attractive for the development of interventional MRI therapies and operations. If a robot were available, these therapies would be minimally invasive, with more accu-rate guidance than is possible with current CT-guided systems. Actuation of a robot in an MRI environment is difficult because of the presence of strong magnetic fields. Therefore, the robot must be constructed of nonmagnetic materials. The system frame was manufactured using polyeth-ylene terephthalate (PET) and was actuated using ultrasonic motors. Accuracy-evaluation proce-dures and phantom tests have been performed. The total accuracy of the system was approximately 3.0 mm. No artifacts caused by the manipulator were observed in the images. 7 Image {\&}id Surg 1:242-248 (1995). a1996 Wdey-Liss, Xnc.},

A virtual needle insertion simulator with a four-layer tissue model (skin, fat, muscle, and bone) and haptic feedback is used for perceptual experiments. The task was to detect the puncture of a particular layer using haptic and visual cues provided by the simulation. The results show that the addition of force feedback reduces error in detection of transitions between tissue layers by at least 55{\%}. The addition of real-time visual feedback (image overlay) improved user performance by at least 87{\%} in scenarios without force feedback. Presentation of both force and visual feedback improved performance by at least 43{\%} in comparison to scenarios without feedback. These results suggest that real-time image overlay provides greater improvement in performance than force feedback.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A robotic system is presented for flexible needle steering and control in soft tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Flexible needle insertion into a deformable tissue is modeled as a linear beam supported by virtual springs, where the stiffness coefficients of the springs can vary along the needle. Using this simplified model, the forward and inverse kinematics of the needle are solved analytically, thus enabling both path planning and path correction in real time. Given target and obstacle locations, the computer calculates the needle tip trajectory that will avoid the obstacle and hit the target. Using the inverse kinematics algorithm, the corresponding needle base maneuver needed to follow this trajectory is calculated. RESULTS: It is demonstrated that the needle tip path is not unique and can be optimized to minimize lateral pressure of the needle body on the tissue. Needle steering, i.e., the needle base movements that steer the needle tip, is not intuitive. Therefore, the needle insertion procedure is best performed by a robot. The model was verified experimentally on muscle and liver tissues by robotically assisted insertion of a flexible spinal needle. During insertion, the position and shape of the needle were recorded by X-ray. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability to curve a flexible needle by its base motion in order to achieve a planned tip trajectory.},

abstract = {In this paper, a two-layer approach is presented to guarantee the stable behavior of bilateral telemanipulation systems in the presence of time-varying destabilizing factors such as hard contacts, relaxed user grasps, stiff control settings, and/or communication delays. The approach splits the control architecture into two separate layers. The hierarchical top layer is used to implement a strategy that addresses the desired transparency, and the lower layer ensures that no {\&}{\#}x201C;virtual{\&}{\#}x201D; energy is generated. This means that any bilateral controller can be implemented in a passive manner. Separate communication channels connect the layers at the slave and master sides so that information related to exchanged energy is completely separated from information about the desired behavior. Furthermore, the proposed implementation does not depend on any type of assumption about the time delay in the communication channel. By complete separation of the properties of passivity and transparency, each layer can accommodate any number of different implementations that allow for almost independent optimization. Experimental results are presented, which highlight the benefit of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {A methodology for estimating the force distribution that occurs along a needle shaft during insertion is described. An experimental system for measuring planar tissue phantom deformation during needle insertions has been developed and is presented. A two-dimensional linear elastostatic material model, discretised using the finite element method, is used to derive contact force information that is not directly measurable. This approach provides a method for quantifying the needle forces and soft tissue deformations that occur during general needle trajectories in multiple dimensions. The needle force distribution is used for graphical and haptic real-time simulations of needle insertion. Since the force displacement relationship is required only along the needle, a condensation technique is shown to achieve very fast interactive simulations. Stiffness matrix changes corresponding to changes in boundary conditions and material coordinate frames are performed using low-rank matrix updates.},

Axial forces during robotic insertion to human vertebrae fixed with formalin (water solution of formaldehyde(FA)) did not exceed 25 N when the feed rate was no more than 0.5 mm/s. There was relatively strong correlation between the axial force variation during insertion and the distribution of bone local CT-value along the needle path. This result shows the importance of preoperative X-ray CT image guidance for robotic needle insertion with safely small axial forces. There was no significant influence of FA-fixation on axial forces during robotic needle insertion to human femoral heads. The forces during robotic insertion to human femoral head were as small as less than 50{\%} of those during manual insertion, and which indicates that the robot can contribute to the safe needle insertion to human vertebra in percutaneous vertebroplasty.},

The main goal of teleoperated needle insertion is accurate tracking of needle in free motion and during insertion. In this research a 1-DOF master/slave needle insertion is introduced. The uncertain dynamics of the slave robot has been considered through the teleoperation loop. An impedance controller has been used for master side and a sliding-mode-based impedance controller is proposed for the slave robot to compensate its uncertain dynamics. Robust control architecture was used to optimize the fidelity measure with constraints on the free motion tracking requirements and robust stability of the system under uncertainties of the soft environment. The validity of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by experiments with a teleoperation needle insertion set-up. Experimental results indicated effectiveness of this controller to achieve precise tracking during contact and free motion. {\textcopyright} 2011 IFAC.},

The PSPM modulates the original set-position signal in such a way that the modulated signal is as close to the original signal as possible (i.e., maximum information recovery for better performance), yet only to the extent permissible by the available energy in the system (i.e., passivity constraints). We present its algorithm and theoretically show its passivity and performance. We also show how this PSPM can be applied for two applications, with some experimental results: Internet teleoperation with varying delay and packet loss; and haptics with slow and variable-rate data update.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of X-rays, medical imaging has played a major role in the guidance of surgical procedures. While medical imaging began with simple X-ray plates to indicate the presence of foreign objects within the human body, the advent of the computer has been a major factor in the recent development of this field. Imaging techniques have grown greatly in their sophistication and can now provide the surgeon with high quality three-dimensional images depicting not only the normal anatomy and pathology, but also vascularity and function. One key factor in the advances in Image-Guided Surgery (IGS) is the ability not only to register images derived from the various imaging modalities amongst themselves, but also to register them to the patient. The other crucial aspect of IGS is the ability to track instruments in real time during the procedure, and to portray them as part of a realistic model of the operative volume. Stereoscopic and virtual-reality techniques can usefully enhance the visualization process. IGS nevertheless relies heavily on the assumption that the images acquired prior to surgery, and upon which the surgical guidance is based, accurately represent the morphology of the tissue during the surgical procedure. In many instances this assumption is invalid, and intra-operative real-time imaging, using interventional MRI, Ultrasound, and electrophysiological recordings are often employed to overcome this limitation. Although now in extensive clinical use, IGS is often currently perceived as an intrusion into the operating room. It must evolve towards becoming a routine surgical tool, but this will only happen if natural and intuitive human interfaces are developed for these systems.},

Haptic feedback from the one hand improves human perception and therefore the quality of the human-robot interaction, on the other hand it can tamper with the stability of the system when the communication between the master side (where the operator is) and the slave side (where the remote robot interacts with the environment) is not instantaneous but affected by delay and packet drops. In the last 40 years many algorithms have been developed to guarantee the stability of haptic teleoperation in the presence of time delay, many of them based on passivity theory.

In this paper, we study the forces involved during in vivo percutaneous procedures for the development of a force feedback needle insertion robotic system as well as the development of a realistic simulation device. The paper presents different conditions (manual and robotic insertions) and different organs (liver and kidney). Finally, we review some bio-mechanical models of the literature in the light of our measurements.},

abstract = {We are developing a simulation of needle insertion and radioactive seed implantation to facilitate surgeon training and planning for brachytherapy for treating prostate cancer. Inserting a needle into soft tissues causes the tissues to displace and deform: ignoring these effects during seed implantation leads to imprecise seed placements. Surgeons should learn to compensate for these effects so seeds are implanted close to their pre-planned locations. We describe a new 2-D dynamic FEM model based on a 7-phase insertion sequence where the mesh is updated to maintain element boundaries along the needle shaft. The locations of seed implants are predicted as the tissue deforms. The simulation, which achieves 24 frames per second using a 1250 triangular element mesh on a 750Mhz Pentium III PC, is available for surgeon testing by contacting ron@ieor.berkeley.edu.},

abstract = {A novel interactive virtual needle insertion simulation is presented. The simulation models are based on measured planar tissue deformations and needle insertion forces. Since the force-displacement relationship is only of interest along the needle shaft, a condensation technique is shown to reduce the computational complexity of linear simulation models significantly. As the needle penetrates or is withdrawn from the tissue model, the boundary conditions that determine the tissue and needle motion change. Boundary condition and local material coordinate changes are facilitated by fast low-rank matrix updates. A large-strain elastic needle model is coupled to the tissue models to account for needle deflection and bending during simulated insertion. A haptic environment, based on these novel interactive simulation techniques, allows users to manipulate a three-degree-of-freedom virtual needle as it penetrates virtual tissue models, while experiencing steering torques and lateral needle forces through a planar haptic interface.},

abstract = {Ultrasound (US) guided biopsy is a medical pro- cedure routinely performed in clinical practice. This task could be performed by robotic systems to improve the precision in the execution and then the safety for the patient. Both robotic and human procedures could greatly benefit from real-time localization of the needle in US images. This information could guide the robot or the specialists to the correct target point avoiding critical structures. Unfortunately US data provide very low quality images of the needle making this task quite complex, even more if you want to perform the localization on-line during the image acquisition. In this work we present a needle localization method able to extract the needle orientation and the tip position in real time from B-mode US images. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a precise way we use an optical tracking system to measure the position and the orientation of the needle and the US probe. In such a way the comparison is not human dependent (i.e. there are no radiologists manually selecting the needle tip) and fully repeatable. The results show an improvement in term of localization accuracy compared to previous works in literature.},

abstract = {Introducing some form of autonomy in robotic surgery is being considered by the medical community to better exploit the potential of robots in the operating room. However, significant technological steps have to occur before even the smallest autonomous task is ready to be presented to the regulatory authorities. In this paper, we address the initial steps of this process, in particular the development of control concepts satisfying the basic safety requirements of robotic surgery, i.e., providing the robot with the necessary dexterity and a stable and smooth behavior of the surgical tool. Two specific situations are considered: the automatic adaptation to changing tissue stiffness and the transition from autonomous to teleoperated mode. These situations replicate real-life cases when the surgeon adapts the stiffness of her/his arm to penetrate tissues of different consistency and when, due to an unexpected event, the surgeon has to take over the control of the surgical robot. To address the first case, we propose a passivity-based interactive control architecture that allows us to implement stable time-varying interactive behaviors. For the second case, we present a two-layered bilateral control architecture that ensures a stable behavior during the transition between autonomy and teleoperation and, after the switch, limits the effect of initial mismatch between master and slave poses. The proposed solutions are validated in the realistic surgical scenario developed within the EU-funded I-SUR project, using a surgical robot prototype specifically designed for the autonomous execution of surgical tasks like the insertion of needles into the human body.},

Change of the force profile was observed and marked at the instant of the puncture, and robustly eliminated artifacts caused by body motion such as the respiratory or cardiac motion. The agreement between the subjective feeling of a skilled surgeon and the sensor was good. In several cases the sensor detected the puncture even when the surgeon could not clearly identify it. It was suggested that the sensor is potentially more sensitive than skilled professionals.},

Tests with human subjects explored robotic and teleoperated paradigms to detect when the needle contacted a membrane embedded at variable depth in a tissue phantom that approximated the properties of porcine liver. In the first case, naive users detected membranes with a 98.9{\%} success rate as the needle was driven at fixed speed. In the second case, users with experience in needle-based procedures controlled the needle insertion and detected membranes embedded in tissue phantoms with a 98{\%} success rate. In the second experiment, some users detected membranes with very light contact forces, but there was greater subject-to-subject variation.},

In procedures that involve multiple needle insertions such as transrectal ultrasound guided prostate brachytherapy, it is important to reduce tissue deformation before puncture and during insertion. In order to reduce this deformation, we have studied the effect of different trajectories for a 2-DOF robot performing needle insertion in soft tissue. We have compared tissue deformation and infinitesimal force per tissue displacement for different trajectories. According to the results of our experiments, infinitesimal force per displacement is a useful parameter for online trajectory update. Our proposed position/force controller is shown to provide considerable improvement in performance with regard to tissue deformation before puncture.},

The proposed framework uses the simple proportional-derivative control, i.e., the master and slave robots are directly connected via spring and damper over the delayed communication channels. Using the controller passivity concept, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique, and Parseval's identity, we can passify the combination of the delayed communication and control blocks altogether robustly, as long as the delays are finite constants and an upper bound for the round-trip delay is known. Having explicit position feedback through the delayed P-action, the proposed framework enforces master-slave position coordination, which is often compromised in the conventional scattering-based teleoperation. The proposed control framework provides humans with extended physiological proprioception, so that s/he can affect and sense the remote slave environments mainly relying on her/his musculoskeletal systems. Simulation and experiments are performed to validate and highlight properties of the proposed control framework},

abstract = {We explore motion planning for a new class of highly flexible bevel-tip medical needles that can be steered to previously unreachable targets in soft tissue. Planning for these procedures is difficult because the needles bend during insertion and cause the surrounding soft tissues to displace and deform. In this paper, we develop a planning algorithm for insertion of highly flexible bevel-tip needles into soft tissues with obstacles in a 2D imaging plane. Given an initial needle insertion plan specifying location, orientation, bevel rotation, and insertion distance, the planner combines soft tissue modeling and numerical optimization to generate a needle insertion plan that compensates for simulated tissue de formations, locally avoids polygonal obstacles, and minimizes needle insertion distance. The simulator computes soft tissue deformations using a finite element model that incorporates the effects of needle tip and frictional forces using a 2D mesh. We formulate the planning problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem that is locally minimized using a penalty method that converts the formulation to a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems. We apply the planner to bevel-right and bevel-left needles and generate plans for targets that are unreachable by rigid needles.},
