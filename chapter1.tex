\chapter{Introduction} 

\section{Thesis outline}
This thesis is organised in two main workflows: \textit{Verification} and \textit{Methodology}.
Chapter \ref{chap:background} is an overview over the research contribution in the field of  deep learning, edge computing and the other tools discussed in the next chapter of this thesis.
The first workflow is described in chapter \ref{chap:verification}, where a complete inspection and verification was made on the ORB SLAM algorithm to garantee  a deterministic behaviour in a sequential contex.
The second workflow described in chapter \ref{chap:methodology} proposes a solution to the problem of integrating heterogeneous robotic applications.
With the support of edge computing platforms like Kubeedge, some experiments was made to deploy automatically our integrated system from the host (cloud) to the edge.
Finally in chapter \ref{chap:experimental-results} the experimental results are showed and discussed.

%This thesis arises from a collaboration with the European ICE Lab project assigned to the Computer Science department at the University of Verona.
