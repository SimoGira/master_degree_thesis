\section{Thesis outline}
This thesis is organised as follows: Chapter 2 is an overview over the research contribution in the field of percutaneous procedures, focusing on modelling the action and presenting some robotic system designed for them. In Chapter 3 the key concepts of a teleoperation system and some of the teleoperation schemas developed in the recent years are presented. In Chapter 4  is presented the port-Hamiltonian representation of the investigated teleoperation algorithm  and proved its passivity and the passivity of the two improvements proposed. In Chapter 5 is discussed the implementation of this architecture on a physical setup, lastly in Chapter 6 the experimental results are showed and discussed.
